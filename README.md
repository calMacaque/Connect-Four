# Connect-Four
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game written in Java. Players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid, aiming to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their own discs. The game features a text-based interface and includes functionality for player input validation and win condition checking.
